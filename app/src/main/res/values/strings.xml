        \n\n
<ul>


<li>Avoid building in a floodplain unless you elevate and reinforce your home.\n\n</li>
<li>Elevate the furnace, water heater and electric panel in your home if you live in an area that has a high flood risk.\n\n</li>
<li>Consider installing "check valves" to prevent flood water from backing up into the drains of your home.\n\n</li>
<li>If feasible, construct barriers to stop floodwater from entering the building and seal walls in basements with waterproofing compounds.\n\n</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Secure your home. If you have time, bring in outdoor furniture. Move essential items to an upper floor.\n\n</li>

</ul>
<b>Cleaning up And Repairing Your Home</b>\n\n
<ul>
<li>Turn off the electricity at the main breaker or fuse box, even if the power is off in your community. That way, you can decide when your home is dry enough to turn it back on.\n\n</li>
<li>Enter your home safely.\n\n</li>
<li>Protect your home and belongings from further damage.\n\n</li>
<li>Record damage to support insurance claims and requests for assistance.\n\n</li>

<li>Contact your insurance agent to discuss claims.\n\n</li>
<li>Listen to your radio for information on assistance that may be provided by the state or federal government or other organizations.\n\n</li>

    <li>Follow posted evacuation routes, where present. Take your animals with you but do not delay your evacuation to collect them.\n\n</li>
