Disaster management in India, especially in regions like Kerala, faces persistent challenges like
Inadequate coordination among stakeholders
Limited real-time data visibility
Inefficient immediate rescue plan
Inefficient resource allocation

Develop a user-friendly  Mobile application  that can be used in multiple languages.
We are planning to build the application friendly for differently abled people.

1.Add an emergency situation:
Users can quickly post new emergency situation, providing real-time information to the community.
Users can add necessary details like location and type of emergency.

2.Adding Resources:
Communities can add available resources such as food items, shelter, medical supplies.
Availability of resources is updated in real-time,

3.SOS :
Affected individuals can input their details and estimated survival time based on the situation.
Utilizes algorithms to prioritize response efforts based on urgency and severity.

4.3D/VR Safety Tutorials:
Provides interactive 3D safety tips(tutorials) tailored to different types of emergencies like floods, earthquakes, fires. etc
Enhances user awareness and preparedness for various disaster scenarios.

5.Detailed Map View:
Incorporates a detailed map view based on live data, including colour of alert (Red alert,Orange alert etc),affected areas, available resources, and evacuation routes.
Helps users navigate and make wise decisions during emergencies.
